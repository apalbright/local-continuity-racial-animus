		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span>Title: Introduction of Television to the United States Media Market, 1946-1960</span></p>
								<p><span>Principal Investigator(s): Matthew Gentzkow, University of Chicago, Jesse M. Shapiro, University of Chicago</span></p>
								<p><span>Summary: This study catalogs the introduction of television to media markets in the United States. The file titled, "TV Station Diffusion by DMA, 1946-1960," lists the name and the start date of the first commercial television station in each Nielsen media market (DMA) in the United States. This dataset uses the 2002/2003 definitions of Nielsen media markets. The file titled, "TV Set Diffusion by United States County, 1950-1960," lists by county the number of households that own television sets for the years 1950 and 1953-1960. This study also includes a file titled, "Crosswalk -- County to DMA," that matches each county to its respective DMA(s).</span></p>

		        		<h2>Scope of Project:</h2>
								<p><span>Time Period(s): 1946 -- 1960</span></p>
								<p><span>Date of Collection: 1950, 1953 -- 1960, 1970, 1996-03, 2002-12, 2005-03</span></p>
								<p><span>Data Collection Notes: The file, "TV Station Diffusion by DMA, 1946-1960," compiles the entry data of the first commercial television station that appears in each DMA from the 1960, 1970, and 1954 TV Factbooks and from the 2001 Broadcasting and Cable Yearbook. In each source, the commercial television station with the earliest start date was identified. In the order that they appear above, the earliest commercial television station was identified from the first raw data source that reported a commercial television station for a specific DMA. The file "TV Set Diffusion by United States County, 1950 and 1953-1960," compiles the total number of households and the number of TV-owning households per county reported by the 1950 and 1960 censuses, 1954 TV Magazine, and the 1953 and 1955-1959 TV Factbooks.
The FIPS codes from the 1990 Census GICS were also matched to this file by county and state name. The file "TV Crosswalk -- County to DMA," draws from the 1990 Census GICS and 2002/2003 County DMA, a file provided by Nielsen Media Research. The latter file ranks DMA by the number of households in each DMA that own a television.</span></p>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span>Universe: The file "TV Station Diffusion," reports the entry date for the first commercial TV station in each United States Nielsen media market according to Nielsen's 2002/2003 definition. The file, "TV Set Ownership Diffusion" reports the number of TV-owning households in each United States county for the years 1950 and 1953-1960. The file, "United States County to DMA Crosswalk" reports each United States county and the DMA(s), by the 2002/2003 definition, in which it is located.</span></p>
								<p><span>Unit(s) of Observation: DMA (i.e., Nielsen Media Market)</span></p>
								<p><span>Data Source: Historical, Demographic, Economic, and Social Data: The United States, 1790-2000 [ICPSR 2896], TV Factbook, 1950, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1970, 1962 County Databook (United States Census), 1954 TV Magazine, 2001 Broadcasting and Cable Yearbook, 2002/2003 County DMA (Nielsen Media Research), 1950 United States Census</span></p>
